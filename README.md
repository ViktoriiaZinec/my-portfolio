### CSS

- This was my first time using Tailwind CSS for styling, a highly efficient utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS streamlines the development process by providing a wide range of pre-designed utility classes that can be easily applied to HTML elements. This approach promotes rapid development, improved maintainability, and consistent styling throughout the project.

## Project setup
